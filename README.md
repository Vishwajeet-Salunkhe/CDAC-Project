🚀  **Online Car Service Station** project!

This end-to-end application was an opportunity to design, code, and deploy a production-grade system while applying modern engineering principles. Here’s how we built it 👇

---

⚙️ **Backend – Spring Boot, REST APIs & Secure Architecture**

* **Layered Architecture (Controller → Service → Repository):** Ensures clean separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability.
* **RESTful APIs:** Designed stateless APIs for smooth client-server communication using standard HTTP methods.
* **Spring Security + JWT:** Implemented stateless authentication with custom filters, enabling secure role-based access control (Admin/Customer).
* **Spring Data JPA + Hibernate:** Simplified persistence with MySQL. We modeled complex relationships (Bookings ↔ Services) with entities like `BookedService` to capture real-world business rules.
* **Global Exception Handling:** Centralized error responses for consistency and reliability.
* **DTO Pattern:** Ensured safe and clean API contracts between client and server.

---

💡 **Principles & Patterns We Followed**

* **SOLID Principles:** Single Responsibility in services (`BookingService`, `PaymentService`), Dependency Inversion by coding to interfaces (`JpaRepository`, `PasswordEncoder`).
* **Design Patterns:** Facade (simplified business logic in service layer), Adapter (integrating our user model with Spring Security).
* **Inversion of Control (IoC) & Dependency Injection:** Leveraged Spring’s IoC container to manage beans like `PasswordEncoder`, making the system flexible and testable.

---

🎨 **Frontend – Modern React Stack**

* **React + Vite:** For a fast, modular, and responsive UI.
* **Redux Toolkit:** Centralized and predictable state management across the app.
* **Axios Interceptors:** Streamlined API communication with automatic JWT injection and unified error handling.

---

🐳 **Efficiency & Deployment**

* **Docker (Multi-stage builds):** Packaged backend & frontend into lightweight containers, ensuring environment consistency.
* **Deployment on GCP Compute Engine:** Achieved a scalable cloud deployment with containerized services running reliably on Google Cloud.

---

✅ **Key Takeaway**
Every tech choice was deliberate & logical:

* **Spring Security + JWT** → Secure authentication & role-based access.
* **DTOs + REST APIs** → Clean and consistent client-server communication.
* **Docker + GCP** → Scalable, cloud-ready deployments.

This project reflects the ability to **apply engineering principles, build production-ready systems, and deliver end-to-end solutions**.
